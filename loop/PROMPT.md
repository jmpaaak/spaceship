# Spaceship autonomous development brief

## First priority

Build the playable portrait-mobile roguelite specified in `docs/feedback/INBOX.md` and `docs/GAME_DESIGN.md`:

`launch → ascending → fuel-empty return/slots → Earth settlement/shop → relaunch`.

Durability destruction must wipe unbanked samples, money, purchased ship, and upgrades while preserving only all-time maximum height.

## Required workflow

1. Read only the pending feedback, game design, and current status needed for this cycle.
2. Run `git status --short` before editing. Preserve and finish prior-cycle work; do not overwrite it.
3. If preflight reports FAIL, reproduce and fix that exact failure first.
4. Otherwise choose one small user-visible or state-machine slice from the top pending requirement.
5. Use test-driven development: add a failing engine-hosted test, observe RED, implement, then run focused GREEN tests.
6. Run `make verify LOVE=/Users/jm/.local/bin/love` before a checkpoint commit.
7. Update `docs/STATUS.md` with verified facts and the exact next slice. Commit owned changes with a specific message. Push only after tests pass and the worktree is clean.

## Non-negotiable game rules

- Portrait internal canvas `180×320`; phone portrait is the product orientation.
- Earth is below and progression is upward. Free-roaming landscape exploration is superseded.
- Increasing height increases planet/sample value and risk.
- Fuel 0 starts automatic return; return distance controls slot opportunities.
- Planet collision damages durability.
- Durability 0 performs the full meta wipe, preserving only personal best height.
- Safe Earth return converts samples/slot rewards to money and permits ship purchase/upgrades.

## AetherAI-only asset rule

- Every final visual asset—ship, Earth, planets, samples, effects, slot symbols, shop icons, backgrounds—must come from the official AetherForgeAI/AetherAI UI or official API.
- Never crawl, scrape, macro, or automate the AetherAI website.
- Never generate final art with Python/Pillow, Lua, another image model, or hand-authored raster scripts.
- Until an official export and receipt exist, simple Lua shapes may remain only as visibly documented `DEV PLACEHOLDER` gameplay geometry. Do not call them final assets or visual QA.
- Do not invent provenance. Official imports require source/terms URL, generation/asset ID, prompt/model/style/settings, timestamp, original SHA-256, dimensions, and runtime QA.
- If login/export is unavailable, mark art human-gated and continue non-asset gameplay, tests, persistence, balancing, touch input, packaging, and UI layout work.

## Safety and scope

- Work only in `/Users/jm/orca/workspaces/interactive-story-game-factory/spaceship`.
- Do not access credentials or paid actions.
- Do not edit or stop the `man-of-korea` loop.
- Do not claim device QA without an actual device result.
- One fresh cycle owns the checkout at a time; respect `loop/STOP`.
